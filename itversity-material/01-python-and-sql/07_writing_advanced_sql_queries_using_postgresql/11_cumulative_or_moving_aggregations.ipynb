    "Let us understand how we can take care of cumulative or moving aggregations using Analytic Functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When it comes to Windowing or Analytic Functions we can also specify window spec using `ROWS BETWEEN` clause.\n",
    "* Even when we do not specify window spec, the default window spec is used. For most of the functions the default window spec is `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`. You also have special clauses such as `CURRENT ROW`.\n",
    "* Here are some of the examples with respect to `ROWS BETWEEN`.\n",
    "  * `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`\n",
    "  * `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`\n",
    "  * `ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`\n",
    "  * `ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` - moving aggregations using current record and previous 3 records.\n",
    "  * `ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 3 FOLLOWING` - moving aggregations using current record and following 3 records.\n",
    "  * `ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 FOLLOWING` - moving aggregations based up on 7 records (current record, 3 previous records and 3 following records)\n",
    "* We can leverage `ROWS BETWEEN` for cumulative aggregations or moving aggregations.\n",
    "* Here is an example of cumulative sum."
