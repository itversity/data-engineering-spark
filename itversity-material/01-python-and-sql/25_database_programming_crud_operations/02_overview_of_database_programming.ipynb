    "## Overview of Database Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us get an Overview of Database Programming.\n",
    "* When we develop web or mobile applications, data is typically stored in RDBMS Databases such as Oracle, Postgres, Mysql etc..\n",
    "* Even data for reporting and analytics is typically stored in Data Warehouse or MPP Databases such as Redshift, Snowflake, Teradata etc.\n",
    "* Here are different varieties of Databases for different purposes.\n",
    "  * RDBMS - for example: Oracle, Mysql, Postgres, informix, MS SQL, DB2 etc.\n",
    "  * Data Warehouse - for example: Teradata, Vertica, Greenplum, RedShift, Snowflake etc.\n",
    "  * NoSQL - for example: MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, DynamoDB etc.\n",
    "  * Search based - Elasticsearch, Solr etc\n",
    "  * Graph based - Neo4J\n",
    "* Almost all the databases provide JDBC driver to connect to the database from application layer. \n",
    "* Web or Mobile Applications are typically developed using Programming Languages like Python, Scala, Java etc.\n",
    "* Data Engineering is typically done by tools such as Informatica or Programming Languages such as Python.\n",
    "* We need to use the JDBC or ODBC driver provided to connect to the specific database where ever Databases are involved irrespective of the database that is used.\n",
    "* Also one should be familiar with underlying Database Concepts to be comfortable with Database programming.\n",
    "* Typically Databases will be setup on remote servers and accessible using the following information:\n",
    "  * Server IP or DNS Alias on which Database Server is running.\n",
    "  * Port Number using which Database Server is running.\n",
    "  * Username\n",
    "  * Password\n",
    "  * Database Name\n",
    "* We typically perform CRUD Operations against our databases for Web or Mobile Applications for the transactions.\n",
    "* For non transactional use cases, we typically process data in batches either with in Databases or off load to ETL tools or distributed processing engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "As part of this module we will primarily focus on CRUD operations.\n",
    "```"
