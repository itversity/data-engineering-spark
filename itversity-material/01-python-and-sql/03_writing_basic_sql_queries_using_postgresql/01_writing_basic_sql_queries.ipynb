    "* What are different standard transformations and how they are implemented using Basic SQL?\n",
    "* Understand the data model using which basic SQL features are explored?\n",
    "* Setup the database, tables and load the data quickly\n",
    "* How we typically select or project the data, filter the data, join data from multiple tables, compute metrics using aggregate functions, sort the data etc?\n",
    "* While exploring basic SQL queries, we will define a problem statement and come up with a solution at the end.\n",
    "* Self evaluate whether one understood all the key aspects of writing basic SQL queries using exercises at the end."
