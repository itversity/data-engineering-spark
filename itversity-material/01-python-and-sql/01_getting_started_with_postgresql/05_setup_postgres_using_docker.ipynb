    "In some cases you might want to have postgres setup on your machine. Let us understand how we can setup Postgres using Docker.\n",
    "* If you are using our labs, the database will be pre-created by us with all the right permissions.\n",
    "* If you are using Windows or Mac, ensure that you have installed Docker Desktop.\n",
    "* If you are using Ubuntu based desktop, make sure to setup Docker.\n",
    "* Here are the steps that can be used to setup Postgres database using Docker.\n",
    "  * Pull the postgres image using `docker pull`\n",
    "  * Create the container using `docker create`.\n",
    "  * Start the container using `docker start`.\n",
    "  * Alternatively we can use `docker run` which will pull, create and start the container.\n",
    "  * Use `docker logs` or `docker logs -f` to review the logs to ensure Postgres Server is up and running.\n",
