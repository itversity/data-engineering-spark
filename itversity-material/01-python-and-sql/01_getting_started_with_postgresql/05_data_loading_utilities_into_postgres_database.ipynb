    "## Data Loading Utilities into Postgres Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand how we can load the data into databases using utilities provided.\n",
    "* Most of the databases provide data loading utilities.\n",
    "* One of the most common way of getting data into database tables is by using data loading utilities provided by the underlying datatabase technology.\n",
    "* We can load delimited files into database using these utilities.\n",
    "* Here are the steps we can follow to load the delimited data into the table.\n",
    "  * Make sure files are available on the server from which we are trying to load.\n",
    "  * Ensure the database and table are created for the data to be loaded.\n",
    "  * Run relevant command to load the data into the table.\n",
    "  * Make sure to validate by running queries.\n",
    "* Let us see a demo by loading a sample file into the table in Postgres database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading Data\n",
    "We can use COPY Command using `psql` to copy the data into the table.\n",
    "* Make sure database is created along with the user with right permissions. Also the user who want to use `COPY` command need to have **pg_read_server_files** role assigned.\n",
    "* Connect to the Postgres Database on **pg.itversity.com** as super user postgres and run relevant grant command to grant the permissions.\n",
