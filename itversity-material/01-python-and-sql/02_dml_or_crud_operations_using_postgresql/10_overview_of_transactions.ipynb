    "Let us go through the details related to Transactions.* We typically perform operations such as `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` via the applications.\n",
    "* `COMMIT` will persist the changes in the database.\n",
    "* `ROLLBACK` will revert the uncommitted changes in the database.\n",
    "* We typically rollback the uncommitted changes in a transaction if there is any exception as part of the application logic flow.\n",
    "* For example, once the order is placed all the items that are added to shopping cart will be rolled back if the payment using credit card fails.\n",
    "* By default every operation is typically committed in Postgres. We will get into the details related to transaction as part of application development later.\n",
    "* Commands such as `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` typically comes under TCL (Transaction Control Language)"
