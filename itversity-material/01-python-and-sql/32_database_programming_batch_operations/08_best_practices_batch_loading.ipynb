    "## Best Practices - Batch Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us go through some of the best practices to perform batch load.\n",
    "* We should minimize the number of connections to database.\n",
    "* We should avoid executing queries using hard coded values. Rather, we should prefer bind variables.\n",
    "* Too much committing is bad as commit incurs overhead.\n",
    "* If we have to load considerable amount of data, we should consider committing every 1,000 records or 10,000 records or even more based up on the capacity of the database.\n",
    "* Most of the mainstream databases perform direct path I/O or batch load which might perform better compare to looping, inserting and committing data. In some cases, we can use those features."
