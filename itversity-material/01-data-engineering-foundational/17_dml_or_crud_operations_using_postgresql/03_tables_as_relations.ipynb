        "* In RDBMS - R stands for Relational.\n",
        "* In the transactional systems, tables are created using normalization principles. There will be relations or tables created based on relationships among them.\n",
        "* Here are the typical relationships among the tables.\n",
        "  * 1 to 1\n",
        "  * 1 to many or many to 1 (1 to n or n to 1)\n",
        "  * many to many (m to n)\n",
        "* To **enforce** relationships we typically define constraints such as **Primary Key** and **Foreign Key**.\n",
        "* Here is the typical process we follow from requirements to physical database tables before building applications.\n",
        "  * Identify entities based up on the requirements.\n",
        "  * Define relationships among them.\n",
        "  * Create ER Diagram (Entity Relationship Diagram). It is also called as Logical Data Model.\n",
        "  * Apply Normalization Principles on the entities to identify tables and constraints to manage relationships among them.\n",
        "  * Come up with Physical Data Model and generate required DDL Scripts.\n",
        "  * Execute the scripts in the database on which applications will be eventually build based up on business requirements.\n",
        "* Logical modeling is typically done by Data Architects.\n",
        "* Physical modeling is taken care by Application Architect or Development lead.\n",
        "* Let us go through [data model](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28328/diagrams.htm) related to HR and OE systems.\n",
        "  * Identify the relationships between the tables.\n",
        "  * Differentiate between transactional tables and non transactional tables."
